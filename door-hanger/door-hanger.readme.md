# TODO

- can each hook have a bottom "brace" that traces back to the spine? I'd love it if I could control the brace parameters too, like either the angle of it or if that's too hard we can do either: the length of the hypotenuse, or the "height" of the brace, and it will just form a hypotenuse to the bottom part of the hook furthest from the spine.
- can this brace be hollow?
- can we apply a generic border radius to any corner instead of a hard 90 angle? I'm going to 3d print these so I need the profile we extrude to have rounded corners for anything that would cause a sharp toolpath turn (internal and external both accounted for)
